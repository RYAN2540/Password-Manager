## Description

<table>
<tr>
<td>
Password Locker is an app that allows multiple users to store their login credentials for the different accounts they may have. These credentials include usernames and passwords. Users first sign up for an account in the app, after which they should be able to login and logout for as long as the app is running.

Upon successful login, a user navigates their account through an options menu that gives them a chance to add their existing credentials, create new credentials, view saved credentials, copy specific credentials to clipboard, delete a saved credential, and logout. The app also gives a user an option for a system generated password of their desired length whenever the user needs to create a password.
